1. Package Management
Install, update, or remove software packages using Ansible's apt, yum, or dnf modules (depending on the Linux distribution).
Example:

yaml
Copy code
- name: Ensure NGINX is installed
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present
    update_cache: yes
This will install NGINX on an Ubuntu-based system. For CentOS, you could use the yum module.

2. File/Directory Management
Create, delete, or modify files and directories with Ansibleâ€™s file, copy, template, or lineinfile modules.
Example:

yaml
Copy code
- name: Ensure /etc/myapp/config.conf exists with specific content
  copy:
    dest: /etc/myapp/config.conf
    content: |
      setting1=value1
      setting2=value2
    owner: root
    group: root
    mode: '0644'
This task ensures that a configuration file exists with specific content.

3. User and Group Management
Create users, manage groups, or update user attributes using Ansible's user and group modules.
Example:

yaml
Copy code
- name: Ensure the 'developer' user exists
  user:
    name: developer
    state: present
    shell: /bin/bash
    groups: sudo
This will create the user developer and add them to the sudo group.

4. Service Management
Start, stop, or enable services (like Apache, NGINX, MySQL, etc.) using the service module or systemd module.
Example:

yaml
Copy code
- name: Ensure NGINX is running and enabled
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: started
    enabled: yes
This ensures that the NGINX service is running and enabled to start on boot.

5. System Updates
Apply security patches or full system upgrades using Ansible's apt or yum modules.
Example:

yaml
Copy code
- name: Update all packages on Ubuntu/Debian
  apt:
    upgrade: yes
    update_cache: yes
    cache_valid_time: 3600
This task updates all installed packages on a Debian-based system.

1. Automating LVM (Logical Volume Management) Setup
Creating, extending, or managing LVM volumes requires interacting with disk partitions, logical volumes, and file systems. Ansible provides modules like lvol, vg, and pv to manage LVM resources.
Example:

yaml
Copy code
- name: Create a new volume group
  lvm_vg:
    name: my_vg
    pvs: /dev/sdb
    state: present

- name: Create a new logical volume
  lvm_lvol:
    vg: my_vg
    name: my_lvol
    size: 10G
    state: present
This automates the process of setting up LVM storage, including creating a volume group and a logical volume. This is a powerful and complicated task involving multiple components of the system's storage layer.

2. Managing Complex Network Configurations
Setting up network interfaces with advanced configurations (e.g., bonding, VLANs, etc.) requires modifying system network files or using tools like nmcli (NetworkManager). Ansible can manage these configurations using the network or nmcli modules.
Example:

yaml
Copy code
- name: Configure network bonding
  nmcli:
    conn_name: bond0
    ifname: bond0
    type: bond
    mode: 802.3ad
    bond_options: mode=active-backup miimon=100
    slaves:
      - eth0
      - eth1
This task configures a network bond with two interfaces (eth0 and eth1) in a high-availability mode (802.3ad or active-backup), which can be tricky to manage across different Linux distributions.

3. Automating Security Hardening with SELinux or AppArmor
Managing and enforcing SELinux/AppArmor policies involves complex configurations for system security and requires a thorough understanding of security policies. Ansible can be used to set SELinux modes, manage contexts, or apply security policies.
Example:

yaml
Copy code
- name: Set SELinux to enforcing mode
  seboolean:
    name: httpd_can_network_connect
    state: yes
    persistent: yes

- name: Set SELinux enforcing mode globally
  command: setenforce 1
  become: true
This task ensures that SELinux is in enforcing mode and that it applies the correct policies to secure the system. It is a complex task because managing SELinux/AppArmor policies requires understanding file contexts, booleans, and labeling.

4. Implementing a Cluster (e.g., High-Availability or Load Balancing)
Setting up a high-availability cluster or load balancer involves multiple systems and services (e.g., HAProxy, Corosync, Pacemaker, etc.). These systems typically need to communicate with each other and rely on a shared configuration, making it a non-trivial task to automate.
Example:

yaml
Copy code
- name: Install and configure HAProxy load balancer
  package:
    name: haproxy
    state: present

- name: Configure HAProxy
  template:
    src: haproxy.cfg.j2
    dest: /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
    mode: 0644

- name: Restart HAProxy service
  service:
    name: haproxy
    state: restarted
Setting up a load balancer and ensuring it is properly configured to handle failover or distribute traffic across multiple application servers can be a complex task, especially when dealing with SSL termination, session persistence, or advanced routing strategies.

5. Database Backup and Restore Automation
Automating complex database backup and restoration procedures, especially when dealing with large databases, incremental backups, or multi-node setups (e.g., MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB), requires custom logic and integrations with external systems.
Example:

yaml
Copy code
- name: Backup MySQL database
  command: mysqldump -u root -p{{ mysql_root_password }} --all-databases > /backups/mysql_backup.sql
  become: true

- name: Copy backup to remote storage
  synchronize:
    src: /backups/mysql_backup.sql
    dest: s3://mybucket/backups/mysql_backup.sql
    mode: push

- name: Restore MySQL database
  command: mysql -u root -p{{ mysql_root_password }} < /backups/mysql_backup.sql
  become: true
This task handles creating a backup, copying it to remote storage, and restoring the database. However, database backups often require special handling for large datasets, consistency, and ensuring that the backup is performed without causing service interruptions. In production environments, it often involves setting up cron jobs, monitoring backup success, and testing restores.
